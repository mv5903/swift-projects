## Swift Projects

Welcome to my active repository dedicated to making iOS and iPadOS apps! I appreciate your time to view this repository! 
<br>
Here's what I am currently working on or have planned:
<br>
1. Really Simple Series, where I develo utility apps for the purpose of simplicity. There's never any data collection or advertisements in these apps. They are just simple and easy to use, with lots of customizability.
2. *(Planned)* Knockoff of Tinder, aimed at providing free features without a subscription-based model.
3. *(Planned)* A Simple Game series for all the games we know and love, such as chess, tic-tac-toe, and checkers.
